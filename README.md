# ZF_Smart_Camera
Repo for Smart Camera 4.8 Web Page

## Main idea:
Take one smart camera ECU mount it into a fixture that shows all the components disassembled and arranged in an exploded view (as shown in the image). This device will have a QR code that will direct you to an interactive application/webpage that shows all the components and their functionalities.

## Resources needed:
- Camera ECU (scrap)
- Fixture development (3D printed or acrylic)
- Application/webpage development
